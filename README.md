# DorXNG
DorXNG is a modern solution for harvesting `OSINT` data using advanced search engine operators through multiple upstream search providers. On the backend it leverages a purpose built containerized image of [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/), a self-host, hackable, privacy focused, meta-search engine.

Our SearXNG implementation routes all search queries over the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) network while refreshing circuits every ten seconds with the `MaxCircuitDirtiness` configuration directive. This allows for evasion of search engine restrictions commonly encountered while issuing many repeated search queries.

The DorXNG client application is written in Python3, and interacts with the SearXNG API to issue search queries concurrently. It can even issue requests across multiple SearXNG instances. The resulting search results are stored in a `SQLite3` database.

#### Please DO NOT use the DorXNG client application against any public SearXNG instances.

## Shout Outs

Shout out to the developers of `Tor` and `SearXNG` for making this possible. Go donate to both projects!

Shout out to the developer of [pagodo](https://github.com/opsdisk/pagodo) for the inspiration and that sweet [ghdb_scraper.py](https://github.com/opsdisk/pagodo/blob/master/ghdb_scraper.py) script!

# Setup

#### LINUX ONLY ** Sorry Normies **

Install DorXNG

```
git clone https://github.com/researchanddestroy/dorxng
cd dorxng
pip install -r requirements.txt
./DorXNG.py -h
```

Download and Run Our Custom SearXNG Docker Container (at least one). Multiple SearXNG instances can be used. Use the `--serverlist` option with DorXNG.

#### When starting multiple containers wait a few seconds between starting each one.
```
docker run researchanddestroy/searxng:latest
```

If you would like to build the container yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/researchanddestroy/searxng # The URL must be all lowercase for the build process to complete
cd searxng
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 make docker.build
docker images
docker run <image-id>
```
By default DorXNG has a hard-coded `server` variable in [parse_args.py](https://github.com/ResearchandDestroy/DorXNG/blob/main/parse_args.py) which is set to the IP address that Docker will assign to the first container you run on your machine `172.17.0.2`. This can be changes, or overwritten with `--server` or `--serverlist`.

Start Issuing Search Queries
```
./DorXNG.py -q 'search query'
```

Query the DorXNG Database
```
./DorXNG.py -D 'regex search string'
```

# Tips

Sometimes you will hit a Tor exit node that is already shunted by upstream search providers, causing you to receive a minimal amount of search results. Not to worry... Just keep firing off queries. üòâ

Keep your DorXNG SQL database file and rerun your command, or use the `--loop` switch to iterate the main function repeatedly. üîÅ

Most often, the more passes you make over a search query the more results you'll find. üçª

Keep in mind that DorXNG will continue to append new search results to the `dorxng.db` database file if you don't use the `--database` switch to specify a different database file. This probably doesn't matter for most, but if you want to keep your `OSINT` investigations seperate it's there for you. 

Four concurrent search requests seems to be the sweet spot. You can issue more, but the more queries you issue at a time the longer it takes to receive results. It also increases the likelihood you receive `HTTP/429 Too Many Requests` responses from upstream search providers on that specific Tor circuit.

If you start multiple SearXNG Docker containers too rapidly Tor connections may fail to establish.
While initializing a container, a valid response from the Tor Connectivity Check looks like this:
```
Checking Tor Connectivity..
{"IsTor":true,"IP":"<tor-exit-node>"}
```
If you see anything other than that, or if you start to see `HTTP/500` response codes coming back from the SearXNG monitor script (STDOUT in the container), kill the Docker container and spin up a new one.

There really isn't a reason to run a ton of these containers... Yet... üòâ How many you run really depends on what you're doing. Each container uses approximately `1.25GBs` of RAM.

Running one container works perfectly fine. Running multiple is nice because each has its own Tor curcuit thats refreshing every 10 seconds.

When running `--serverlist` mode disable the `--timeout` feature so there is no delay between requests (default delay is 4 seconds).

Just keep in mind that the more containers you run the more memory you will need. This goes for deep recursion too...

The more recursions your command goes through the more memory the process will consume. You may come back to find your command has crashed with a `Killed` error message. If this happens your machine ran out of memory and killed the process. Not to worry though... Your database file is still good. üëçüëç
